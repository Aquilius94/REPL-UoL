## Computational Mathematics

This module helps you hone your skills in thinking abstractly. It also
introduces you to many of the standard continuous models used to help
understand and design computational systems. Through this module, you
will develop the fundamental computational mathematical tools that
will support you throughout the BSc programme. Particular attention is
paid to notions of experimentation, reasoning, and generalisation. By
taking this module, you will learn a wide range of the computational
mathematical concepts and techniques that underpin Computer Science.
In particular, you will study number systems, special functions,
graphing and linear algebra.

## Professor(s)

- Dr. Sarah Santos (In past iteration of Numerical Mathematics module)
- Dr. Gerardo Aquina
- Dr. Mark D' Inverno
